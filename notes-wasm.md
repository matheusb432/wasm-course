# WebAssembly

- WebAssembly (WASM) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine designed to be a compilation target for high-level languages like Rust/C++/C#/Go
  - Devs prefer a language with a strong background in systems programming, like Rust, to write code that compiles to WASM.
- WASM enables execution of code at near-native speed in the browser.
- WASM is most useful for CPU-intensive tasks like image processing, physics simulations, and cryptography.
